## Style Guidelines:

- **UI/UX**: The gamification elements should be seamlessly integrated into the existing UI, making it feel like a natural part of the learning experience.
- **Visual Cues**: Use animations and visual cues to make the experience more engaging. For example, a celebratory animation when a user levels up or unlocks an achievement.
